onboarding.tour-tor-privacy.title=Snub trackers and snoopers.
onboarding.tour-tor-privacy.description=Tor Browser will isolate all traffic for each domain you visit. That means trackers and advertisers can’t follow you. And any information storage such as isolated cookies or browser history is deleted after your session. We make all these modifications to ensure your privacy and security protections in the browser. Click ‘Tor Network’ to learn how we protect you on the network level.

onboarding.tour-tor-network.title=Travel a decentralized network.
onboarding.tour-tor-network.description=Tor Browser will connect you to the Tor Network. Our network protects you more than a VPN because it is not centralized. Tor is a network of servers, we call them relays, run by thousands of volunteers all around the world. This way, there’s no one point of failure and no centralized entity you need to trust in order to enjoy the internet. For each domain you open we create a circuit for you, click on ‘Circuit Display’ to learn how they work.

onboarding.tour-tor-circuit-display.title=See your path.
onboarding.tour-tor-circuit-display.description=For each domain you visit your traffic is relayed and encrypted in a circuit across three relays around the world. This way no website knows where you are connecting from, because they will only see the connection coming from the last relay. If you would like a new circuit you can just request one by clicking ‘New Circuit for this Site’ on our Circuit Display. Click below to see how it works.

onboarding.tour-tor-expect-differences.title=Experience Tips
onboarding.tour-tor-expect-differences.description=With all the security and privacy features provided by the Tor Browser and the Tor Network, your experience while browsing the internet will be a little bit different. You will notice things will run a bit slower since your connection is going through three relays around the world. Sometimes sites will ask you to prove you are a human not a robot and depending on your security options, some things might not work or load. Our goal is to always provide the best experience for our users while not lowering the bar on how to provide real privacy to our users.

You will notice a little onion icon in the URL bar when accessing these services. Click below to see the NYTimes onion services and how they work.
